1. The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it. This relationship is established through a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table, where the "category_id" column references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. This means that each product is associated with exactly one category, as indicated by the presence of the "category_id" field in the "Product" table, which links it to a specific category in the "Product_Category" table.

2. To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using database constraints. Specifically, you can:
   - Apply a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. This constraint ensures that every value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist in the primary key column of the "Product_Category" table, guaranteeing that each product references a valid category.
   - Additionally, you can apply a NOT NULL constraint on the "category_id" column to ensure that every product must have a category assigned to it, preventing the insertion of NULL values. This combination of constraints ensures that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a valid category, maintaining data integrity.
